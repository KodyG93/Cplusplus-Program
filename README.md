# Cplusplus-Program
Portfolio of my work in C++ with Python integrated for a grocery store.

*Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
* This project was to help a grocery store maintain a database and list of items purchased on a given day. The items were in a .txt file and read with my app. Once imported, it counts each item and the amount it was purchased and then it can also make it into a histogram saved as a .dat file with smiley faces indicating a purchase of that item. 
 
*What did you do particularly well?
* I really like how I coded the histogram and the color to indicate that it was special. I also enjoyed using different colors to indicate an ERROR or a process succeeded. 

*Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
* As with any of my code as a beginner, there are many places for improvement. I could make it more encapsulated with more C++ and header files then passing in private variables for a more secure code. I'm sure I could clean up some of the classes and put them in their proper place in other files. This may help with load time and make it more efficient. 

*Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
* Honestly, the most challenging part of this was to integrate the two languages together. I had never done that and actually (since I am so new to coding) didnt know that was a possibility. The information to integrate was from a 2019 VS code and Python 3.6 so it was very out of date. Currently I am using VS code 2022 and Python 3.11 and the guide was not matching up to the newest IDE and Python release. I dug deep into StackOverflow and with the assistance of a fellow classmate with the same issues, found a piece of code an awesome person posted that was never talked about in any of our text books. I have added that classmate to my list of support as well as that post from S/O is in my bookmarks for integrating languages. 

*What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
* All of this will be utilized in the future. It will make me a better programmer with a wider knowledge base and ability to integrate lanugages to make the most secure but efficient programs and apps. The most stand out skill was being so resilient to find the answer I knew had to be out there. Once I found it, it was amazing! I felt so accomplished. I will bring that resiliency to any project in the future.
 
*How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
* I made it able to be updated easily with good comments indicating what the code is for and even sometimes a very specific function is commented so its easily understood. Also I was able to keep variables easily changable and even my "for" loops for the format is easily understood and able to be adjusted as needed. It can be adapted to other grocery stores by changing the names of variables or breaking it into more files.
